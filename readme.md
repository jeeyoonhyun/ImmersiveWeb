# 50 days of immersive web

50 days of immersive web is a personal challenge I am doing this summer. 
For one hour a day, I will try working with different immersive technologies that runs in the web browser, fail fast and find out what I really want to focus. 
I will also get rid of perfectionism and value quantity over quality, breadth over depth and consistency over intensity. 
The updated experiments will be archived in [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jeeyoonhyun/) and also in a [github repo](https://github.com/jeeyoonhyun/ImmersiveWeb).

### project theme
    - make 50 interactive mini websites including immersive elements
        - three.js, GLSL and WebGL, Unity, WebXR
    - Make a dedicated collage website where you can try the interactions
### Why did you choose this?
    - Try different technologies on the web
    - Fail fast and learn what I am interested/dive deeper in
### What will your routine be?
    - Wake up at 9am and start working 1 hour everyday
    - Upload whatever I have done for 1 hour

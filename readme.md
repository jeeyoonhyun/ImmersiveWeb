50 days of immersive web is a personal challenge I am doing this summer. 
For one hour a day, I will try working with different immersive technologies that runs in the web browser, fail fast and find out what I really want to focus. 
I will also get rid of perfectionism and value quantity over quality, breadth over depth and consistency over intensity. 
The updated experiments will also be archived in [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jeeyoonhyun/) and a [github repo](https://github.com/jeeyoonhyun/ImmersiveWeb).

### Project Goal
- Make 50 interactive mini websites including immersive elements: three.js, GLSL and WebGL
- Make a dedicated collage website where you can try the interactions

Random noise & ordered dithering postprocessing shaders.
I used these resources: https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/ & https://github.com/hughsk/glsl-dither/blob/master/4x4.glsl .


## [Day 5: Custom Postprocessing](https://50days.netlify.app/day5)

I tried using the DeviceOrientation API. You can rotate the shape with your mobile device.


## [Day 2: Postprocessing](https://50days.netlify.app/day2)

Today I played around with making random shapes and applying the Bloom postprocessing effect on the scene.

# 50 days of immersive web

50 days of immersive web is a personal challenge I am doing this summer. 
For one hour a day, I will try working with different immersive technologies that runs in the web browser, fail fast and find out what I really want to focus. 
I will also try getting rid of perfectionism and value quantity over quality, breadth over depth and consistency over intensity. 
The updated experiments will be archived in [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jeeyoonhyun/) and also in a [github repo](https://github.com/jeeyoonhyun/ImmersiveWeb).
